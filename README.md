**Overview**

The Natural Language to SQL Converter is a project designed to allow users to interact with their databases using natural language. Instead of writing SQL queries, users can input their requests in plain English, and the system will convert these requests into SQL queries, execute them on the server, and return the results.

**Features**

Natural Language Processing: Translates user prompts from natural language to SQL queries.
Database Connectivity: Executes the generated SQL queries on the specified database.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for entering natural language prompts.
Error Handling: Provides meaningful error messages for invalid queries or prompts.
